## Abstract and inspiration 
* Not all people have the ability to know what type of diseases they have, especially at an early stage of diseases. So their cases might become very harmful and very complex, and can not be treated easily. In this project, we will try to help those people who thay fight to figuer out the kind of pain they feel by providing a simple way that might help them with trusted sources to get ideas about their conditions and how dangerous it is.


## Data:
* This book "Professional Guide to Diseases 11th edition"  will be used as a source for this project and all necessary information will be extended from it. 


## Tools and python packages
* Numpy
* Pandas
* sklearn
* PyPDF2
* gensim

## Project Description:
* The goal of this project is clustering the medical textbook, in order to categorize diseases based on the most common words in each disease description by using NLP algorithms and techniques. Furthermore, we will dive more into each disease section and categorize the most common disease in that section based on the signs and symptoms.

All in all, the project will be able to detect diseases that are described in a written way by patients (users).
