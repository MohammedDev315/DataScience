The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports foods from around the world. The database has around 14 tables. In this project, different ideas going to be tested to improve the performers of this company. We can begin with understanding what are the most products that have been sold in what time, county, region, and city. In addition, we can investigate if employees' education, experience, gender have an impact on their productivity or not.
